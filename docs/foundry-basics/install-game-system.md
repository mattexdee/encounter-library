1. Ensure you're on the `Game Systems` tab of the Setup screen.
2. Press the `Install System` button.
3. Once the Package list loads you can search for your Game System at the top of the window. For example, you can find Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Game System by searching `DnD5E`.
4. Once you've found your Game System press the `Install` button.

You can now create a World with this Game System. Let's look at that next.
