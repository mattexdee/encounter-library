[DungeonDraft](https://dungeondraft.net/){:target="_blank"} is an encounter map making software from developer Megasploot who created the fantastic world and regional map making tool [WonderDraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net/){:target="_blank"}. It comes bundled with terrains, walls, floors, lights, and hundreds of objects for a one time charge with a license that allows you to use all of the included assets commercially for free. It also includes custom asset support so you can easily use your own assets or asset packs from your favorite artists like Forgotten Adventures, Tom Cartos, 2 Minute Tabletop, and Crosshead Studios.
