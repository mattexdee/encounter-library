# Chat Features
Messages that you and your party send, dice rolls, and uses of items, features, and spells are all tracked in the Chat Log. Let's take a deeper look at what you as a Player can use the chat to do.

## Messages
Foundry allows you to send messages, whispers, and in/out of character messages. By default normal messages and "in-character" messages will also appear over your Token's head but your Gamemaster may have disabled this.

- **In Character:** To send a message "in character" preface it with `/ic`.
- **Out of Character:** To send a message "out of character" preface it with `/ooc`. Messages sent this way will never appear above your Token.
- **Emote:** To send a message as an "emote" preface it with `/emote` like `/emote dances`.
- **Whisper:** To send a whisper to another player or your Gamemaster enter `/w PlayersName`. To send it to a group of users enter `/w [PlayersName, SecondPlayersName]`.

## Rolling Dice
Foundry has [basic](https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/){ target=_blank } and [advanced](https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice-advanced/){ target=_blank } dice rolling. In most circumstances you can use your character sheet or an Item to roll but if you ever need to manually roll you can enter dice formula like `1d20 + 3 + 2d4` and press enter to roll. You can control who can see your rolls by setting the dropdown box above the chat box to: Public Roll, Private GM Roll, Blind GM Roll, or Self-Roll.
