I\u2019m sure these controls look familiar by now \u2013 we\u2019ve got different brush sizes that you can use the scroll wheel to swap between, or the more precise shape drawing tools. These each make water that has a nice shaded look to it with a subtle water animation. Like buildings, if you connect separate bodies of water together, they will join into one and blend together nicely.</p> <p>You can also adjust the color of the water at its deep and shallow points, making it murky swamp water or a light, clear water as needed. Different pools of water on the same map can be created with different colors, but if you join them together, like walls, they will take on the color of your current selection. Changing the blend distance will change how quickly it transitions from the deep into the shallow color.</p> <p> </p> You can place objects and materials above or below water."},{"location":"dungeondraft-basics/terrain-tools/#the-water-layer","title":"The Water Layer","text":"<p>Water is another thing that you can layer over different terrains since it\u2019s transparent.
